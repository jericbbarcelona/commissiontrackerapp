## Project Overview
This Commission Tracker App has the ability to view the data fetched from Firebase Realtime Database as JSON response.

The architecture used on this app is MVVM and I have used Dagger Hilt for the dependency injection. For the API handling, I have used Retrofit, OkHttp and Coroutines to perform the API operations.

## Project Setup
The gradle plugins for com.android.application and com.android.library may vary depending on the Android Studio version. For the development, I used Electric Eel version which is 7.4.2, for Dolphin version you may set the version to 7.3.0 to be able to build the project successfully.
